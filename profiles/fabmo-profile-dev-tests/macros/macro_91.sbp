'!FABMO!name: Unit error
'!FABMO!description: Notification that file Units do not match Tool 
' Name: Change Unit error
' Description: Notify of inconsistent Units

' This Macro is called by Vectric posts in the process of checking Units
' FabMo will handle a file even if its Units are mismatched to the current tool setting.
'   - So this macro could just provide a warning and return
'   - Or, content could just be deleted, though the macro needs to remain stubbed in to handle legacy Vectric posts

# macros - NOTES for ShopBot Dev Team
This is an updated version of FabMo Macros for "FabMo DT Release 2023".
These will be similar to the previous Sb3 Macro system ... but standardized. Generally, all tools will
use the same macros. The format for standard macros is described in Macro #201. 

To help with interchangeability we employ a set of "Standard Variables" whose "Values" are
set or each machine. This is set up in Macro #201 where values for an individual machine are specified.

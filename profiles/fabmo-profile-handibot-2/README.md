# fabmo-profile-handibot-2
FabMo machine profile for the Handibot Version 2.

# macros - NOTES on macros
While these are updated versions of macros for FabMo; not all variable functionality is in place in Handibot-FabMo usages.
Thus, there is some hard-coding in macros here for temporary use.

# HANDIBOT MACROS DIFFER FROM OTHER TOOLS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO PROX SWITCHES FOR ZEROING

To help with interchangeability we employ a set of standard variables whose values are then set or each tool. This is set up in Macro #201.
THIS HAS NOT BEEN SET UP TO HANDIBOTS YET.

Checkout the new standard variable definitions are in Macro #201.

To use these variables, we just need to call this macro once, just after any new profile is installed.

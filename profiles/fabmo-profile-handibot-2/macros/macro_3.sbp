'!FABMO!description: Automatically Set Axis Zero for XYZ
' Name: Home Tool
' Description: 
'   Automatically Set Axis Zero for XYZ (uses Handibot 2 bump technique) [C3].
' Platform: Handibot2
' Author: Ted Hall, Ryan Sturmer
' History:
'   2016/03/01 - Initial version (th)
'   2016/11/20 - Switched to FRONT for simpler touch. Hard stop at rear still provides more accuracy. (th)
'   2017/08/2 - Updated for new fabmo features (rs)
'   2017/08/26 - Refactored (th)
'   2019/10/06 - Re-written to avoid location variables [%()] (th)
'   2020/01/08 - Fixed := for current_cutter_Zoffset

SU,0                         ' Set to Inches; Units will auto-revert to current starting units at end of file

'--- Settings ---            ' Initializes permanent variables if not already set
$current_cutter_Zoffset := .25
$x_backoff = .075
$y_backoff = .075
$z_backoff = .075

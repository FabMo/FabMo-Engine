# Fabmo Sb4 App
ShopBot Sb4 Desktop View; friendly, familiar CNC interface for ShopBotters

## About
Sb4 is a FabMo App with the look and feel of the legacy Sb3 ShopBot Software -- familiar to ShopBot users, and thus a good starting point for getting comfortable with FabMo. It may also be useful for those wanting to work at the motion-coding level with digital fabrication tools as the OpenSBP language is more human-friendly and programmable than g-code. The Macro (scripting) language of FabMo is also OpenSBP so the Sb4 interface allows testing Macro concepts.

## Getting Started
Starting the App will yield a CNC experinece and offer an interaction somewhat like the older, Windows-based ShopBot Software. The ShopBot CNC language, OpenSBP, is supported along with standard g-code. Interaction with the system is via a menuing system and command line input, similar to the Sb3 ShopBot Software.

## Documentation
Currently the only available documentation is this README and the "CommandRef" PDF that is found under Help. This documentation describes the usage of all the OpenSBP Commands. A more comprehensive "guide" is coming soon that will highlight some of the limited changes to the syntax that were required for compatibility with FabMo features and the new low-level hardware for ShopBot running on FabMo. Documentation for the OpenSBP digital fab syntax is also available at opensbp.org ...

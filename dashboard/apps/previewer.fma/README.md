FabMo Previewer App
===================

The previewer app allows you to view a 3D drawing of GCode or OpenSBP tool
paths.  You can rotate, pan or zoom the drawing using mouse buttons.  The view
includes the following:

  * The dimensions of the bounds of the tool path.
  * X, Y and Z axes indicator at centered (0, 0, 0).
  * A conical representation of the tool and it's current position.
  * A grid of the machine space on the XY plane at Z=zero with user configurable spacing.
  * The path it self color coded by move type.

## Live Mode
When the currently running program is selected for viewing the display will
show the current tool position in real-time and the completed parts of the path
will be colored magenta.

## Path Simulation
When the program is not currently running the user can click the "play" button
to start a simulation of the program.  This simulation can be paused or
restarted.  Simulation speed is configurable.

## Snap to View
Three buttons in the top left of the screen make it possible to snap to views
looking down any one of the three axes.

## Settings Dialog
The gear button will open the settings dialog where the following can be
configured:

  * Simulation speed
  * Display Units
  * Grid step size
  * Show or hide the grid, dimensions, axes or tool.

## Help Dialog
The "i" button in the bottom right opens the help dialog which provides
information about the app's controls, buttons and settings.

## Software Design
The app consists of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON and image files.  These files
have the following purposes:

# /firmware
Currently, this directory contains the previous 'shipping' G2 firmware file for FabMo - which is called `orig_g2.bin` - and it includes the most recent 'development' version of the G2 firmware named with version tag as well as one simply labled `g2.bin` (eventually for auto install/update).
